# VEXORA the Log Recuration Assistant

## 📝 Recent Updates (2025-12-18)

### 🛠 What Changed

- **Refactored LLM Client**: Converted `internal/llm/client.go` from a standalone script to a reusable package. Added a retry mechanism (3 attempts) to handle empty responses from Ollama.
- **Enhanced Database**: Added `GetEntriesByProject`, `GetEntryByID`, and `UpdateEntry` to `internal/database/db.go` to support filtering and updates.
- **New Web Dashboard**: Built a dark-mode web interface (`internal/api/web.go`, `templates/index.html`) using Tailwind CSS. Features include:
  - Project-specific filtering.
  - A "Raw Input" view with terminal-like styling.
  - A "Recurate" button to re-process entries with the AI.
  - A database table view for quick scanning.
- **Routing Updates**: Updated `cmd/main.go` to use Go 1.22+ routing for `/project/{project}` and `/recurate/{id}`.

### 🧠 Why

- The LLM client needed to be integrated into the main server, and local models can be flaky, so retries were essential.
- The web interface transforms the project from a backend API into a usable product for browsing logs.
- "Recuration" allows users to fix or improve AI outputs without manually editing the DB.

### 🛠 What Changed

- **Social Media Expansion**: Updated database schema and UI to support **LinkedIn** and **Instagram** drafts alongside Twitter.
- **Performance Metrics**: Added `processing_time` tracking to the database. The web UI now displays how long the AI took to generate each entry (e.g., "⏱️ 4.2s").
- **Markdown Support**: Integrated `marked.js` in the frontend to properly render the raw Markdown input notes.
- **Forking Capability**: Added a "Fork" feature (`/fork/{id}`) allowing users to create a new version of an entry based on the original raw notes, preserving history.
- **UI Polish**: Added specific icons and styling for the new social platforms and timing badges.

### 🧠 Why

- **Multi-Platform Content**: Developers often cross-post to LinkedIn and Instagram, not just Twitter.
- **Transparency**: Knowing how long the local LLM takes helps manage expectations and debug performance issues.
- **Content Iteration**: "Forking" allows for A/B testing different AI outputs or creating variations for different audiences without losing the original.
