# VEXORA the Log Recuration Assistant

## 📝 Recent Updates (2025-12-18)

### 🛠 What Changed

- **Refactored LLM Client**: Converted `internal/llm/client.go` from a standalone script to a reusable package. Added a retry mechanism (3 attempts) to handle empty responses from Ollama.
- **Enhanced Database**: Added `GetEntriesByProject`, `GetEntryByID`, and `UpdateEntry` to `internal/database/db.go` to support filtering and updates.
- **New Web Dashboard**: Built a dark-mode web interface (`internal/api/web.go`, `templates/index.html`) using Tailwind CSS. Features include:
  - Project-specific filtering.
  - A "Raw Input" view with terminal-like styling.
  - A "Recurate" button to re-process entries with the AI.
  - A database table view for quick scanning.
- **Routing Updates**: Updated `cmd/main.go` to use Go 1.22+ routing for `/project/{project}` and `/recurate/{id}`.

### 🧠 Why

- The LLM client needed to be integrated into the main server, and local models can be flaky, so retries were essential.
- The web interface transforms the project from a backend API into a usable product for browsing logs.
- "Recuration" allows users to fix or improve AI outputs without manually editing the DB.
